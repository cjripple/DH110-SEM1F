## Overview of This Assignment

This is the part where all the creative design process come to life. Building on the principles we have learned thus far, it is now time to build the first design iterations for our project. Design and aethetic choices are important, so this project will involve multiple iterations with different colors and fonts, and lots of testing. These first design prototypes will allow us to create a viable and functional protype later on (which will happen in the next project). The best way to create a great interface design is by doing a lot of design variations, and iterations so it's time to do that. 

The interface designs I am creating are based on the [design protoypes I created here](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/edit/main/assignment05/README.md) for the best understanding of the background of these interfaces below, please review the previous project. This interface design project will allow us to envision the best way to make it easier for users to find resources on the New York State - Commission on Judicial Conduct's website.
