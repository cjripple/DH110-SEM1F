## Overview of This Assignment

This is the part where all the creative design process come to life. Building on the principles we have learned thus far, it is now time to build the first design iterations for our project. Design and aethetic choices are important, so this project will involve multiple iterations with different colors and fonts, and lots of testing. These first design prototypes will allow us to create a viable and functional protype later on (which will happen in the next project). The best way to create a great interface design is by doing a lot of design variations, and iterations so it's time to do that. \

## Purpose of This Assignment

The interface designs I am creating are based on the [design protoypes I created here](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/edit/main/assignment05/README.md) for the best understanding of the background of these interfaces below, please review the previous project. This interface design project will allow us to envision the best way to make it easier for users to find resources on the New York State - Commission on Judicial Conduct's website. So while I laid out the basic structure of the proposed features, this assignment will improve on that structure, and will focus on visual/aesthetic features. I want to make sure my designs are accessible, easy to find and operate in multiple languages, and also feel fluid and quick to use. 

### Step 01 - Get Familiar With the Tool

Thanks to all the in-class assignments, as well as my previous design experience, I have a strong grasp on how to use the Figma platform, and it's advanced features like corner roundness, prototype interactivity, and more. I did spend some time reviewing the last lecture and the documentation she provided, so I could fully grasp how to use the grid tools and other Figma features better. More specifically, I did some research on how to use the "Componen" feature on Figma. 

### Step 02 - Utilize the Tool 

#### Flagship Protoype

This is the main prototyped that is being created and highlighted during this project. You can see more design breakdowns and design decisions happening below. 

#### Typographic Variation 

During this test, I wanted to test some "fancier" and more elegant fonts like Lusitana and Georgia, and compare it with modern, bold fonts like Futura and Roboto. Ater seeing how the UI looked with other fonts, I was pleased with Roboto, which is the font that the website originally used. I will go with this font moving forward.

The rounded corners also look friendlier and more inviting, so I went with the "Search Bar Variation Rounded 2" prototype the second from the right. The person I also did the impression test with agreed with me. 

#### Shape Variation

At this stage, I wanted to test different styles of the search bar. I tested rounded shapes and compared them to straight 90-degree corners. 

I also tested putting the magnifying glass inside the search bar or using it as a dedicated button. After searching the best design practicess for search bars, I learned that it's best to include a dedicated search button [next to the search box, according to what I read.](https://uxplanet.org/design-a-perfect-search-box-b6baaf9599c)

#### Color Variations

One specific color variation test I wanted to investigate was hue of the search bar. I wasn't sure if I should included color emphasis around the search bar field, or the search button or both. I made 16 color variations and tried to compare them. So far, I am not fully confident which design is the best. It may be difficult to see the differences up close, so please observe the [Figma project her](https://www.figma.com/file/4NwQdKMsp7neMUnwnjXb56/DH110---A06?node-id=0%3A1) to get a closer look.

#### Grid Test

Although I prefer working without the grid layover, this allows me to ensure all design elements are evenly spaced out and symmetrical. I made sure to manipulate the gutter and margin size so it would work for me. I made sure to save this as a "Grid Style" so I could easily apply this same overlay to my other designs.

I used a 6 x 12 grid as it looked the best for my frame, which was the iPhone 8 template, which measures 375 x 667.
