## Overview of Usability Testing
Usability testing is a very important process for companies to evaluate a product and maximize how it functions through real-world testing on users. Testing is very expensive, iterative, detailed, and tracks lots of metrics in order to get the most insights and data. A test should have at least five people, but the number should grow depending on the nature of the product.

This website is maintained by the State of New York (state government), and it directs citizens to resources and options for investigating judicial misconduct against certain judges in New York. One of the main purposes of the website is to make it easy to file a complaint, and to find relevant news, resources, and content. 

## Introduction to the Project 
After conducting a thorough heurisitic evaluation of the website, a large amount of issues popped up with consistency and ease of use. [(See the heuristic evaluation here)](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment01) To evaluate these assumptions, it's important to understand how these flaws affect users in the real world. This is where usability testing (UT) comes into play. Since the website had significant issues with [visibility of system status](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visibility-system-status/), [consistency and standards](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/consistency-and-standards/), and [error prevention](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/slips/), among others, this project will evaluate how these issues impede a user from doing what they are trying to do. 

## Purpose of the Project
It's imperative that all users can access services and important information that the State of New York provides, and that includes this department. Since the website is not fully compliant with ADA standards, it poses a challenge to users with disabilities and vision impairments. Secondly, the issues with consistency on the  website pose a challenge to finding resources and options for people that need it. This usability testing project will identify common issues that users face while navigating the website, and suggest improvements to make the website as practical and simple as needed. 

## Methodology 
I made to set up the survey script, privacy policy disclosure, and other elements throughly to make the process straightforward. I also included a handful of questions that I believed were relevant to ask. For the usalbility test, I wanted it to be easy, so I had my sister work through the test with me, while she shared her screen on Zoom. (While I was hoping to do it with a roommate in-person, I was too shy to ask and they were pretty busy the day I wanted to do it). As the participant was interacting with the website, their screen was shared and recorded. As they were filling it out, I timed the milestones and tasks using a stopwatch (but also confirmed the time with the video recording). The participant was given an introduction to the project, the project's goals, an overview of the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct and what they do, as well as an overview of what they would be doing during the Usability Test. The google form outlined all the requirements and steps, and the participant was given time to ask about questions or concerns while starting. The Google form was organized and spaced out with separate pages, descriptions, and clarifying details. Additionally, the questions were designed be clear and straighforward. 

## Survey

###### Note: This form is still open and accepting responses. If you would like to access the contents of the form, or do this usability test, you are free to do so.

## Reflection

This is a great insight into what the world of Usability Testing looks like in the real world. It's fascinating to realize how valuable user/consumer feedback is when developing a product. I've participated in some market research surveys for companies where I provide feedback on daily things I do and use. While this is much different than Usability Testing, I realize that companies allocate a large budget to gathering feedback from real world users. This is another reason why UX job is a fantastic job option; it's very in-demand.
