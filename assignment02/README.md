## Overview of Usability Testing
Usability testing is a very important process for companies to evaluate a product and maximize how it functions through real-world testing on users. Testing is very expensive, iterative, detailed, and tracks lots of metrics in order to get the most insights and data. A test should have at least five people, but the number should grow depending on the nature of the product.

This website is maintained by the State of New York (state government), and it directs citizens to resources and options for investigating judicial misconduct against certain judges in New York. One of the main purposes of the website is to make it easy to file a complaint, and to find relevant news, resources, and content. 

## Introduction to the Project 
After conducting a thorough heurisitic evaluation of the website, a large amount of issues popped up with consistency and ease of use. [(See the heuristic evaluation here)](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment01) To evaluate these assumptions, it's important to understand how these flaws affect users in the real world. This is where usability testing (UT) comes into play. Since the website had significant issues with [visibility of system status](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visibility-system-status/), [consistency and standards](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/consistency-and-standards/), and [error prevention](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/slips/), among others, this project will evaluate how these issues impede a user from doing what they are trying to do. 

## Purpose of the Project
It's imperative that all users can access services and important information that the State of New York provides, and that includes this department. Since the website is not fully compliant with ADA standards, it poses a challenge to users with disabilities and vision impairments. Secondly, the issues with consistency on the  website pose a challenge to finding resources and options for people that need it. This usability testing project will identify common issues that users face while navigating the website, and suggest improvements to make the website as practical and simple as needed. 

## Methodology 
I made to set up the survey script, privacy policy disclosure, and other elements throughly to make the process straightforward. I also included a handful of questions that I believed were relevant to ask. 

## Survey
