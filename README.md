## New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct Project - Connor Ripple

## Introduction to the project

With this project, I wwant to redesign some features on the website to make it more cohesive, and easier for users to find what they need. Most users are looking for information on what they can do about judicial misconduct, and are looking for related resources. 

## Clear Design Statement 

I wish to implement a "Get Help" page that puts the most commonly asked questions in one spot. This is beucaause the current navigataion menu is cluttered nad looks different on certian pages. 

## Competitor Analysis

[Please click here to view my heuristic evaluation.](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/blob/main/assignment01/README.md) This is for the website I will be working on, plus the New York unified courts system website. This details certain design criteria that are strong, and shortcomings based on a review against certain criteria. 

[Please click here to view my pilot test.](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment02) This is the first interview I did with a participant, gathering their feedback and initial thoughts on the website. 

## User Research 

[Please click here to view my persona and scenario assignment.](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment04) With this stage, I did research to identify the users and demographics that would be most likely to use this website. This feedback would help me keep in mind who I am designing this project for. 

## UX Storytelling 
[Please click here to view this assignment](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment05) During this process, I constructed a low fidelity prototype of the design feaures I wanted to implement on this website. This was an early stage design that I sketched out, and I made some improvements along the way.
