## New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct Project - Connor Ripple

## Introduction to the project

With this project, I wwant to redesign some features on the website to make it more cohesive, and easier for users to find what they need. Most users are looking for information on what they can do about judicial misconduct, and are looking for related resources. 

## Clear Design Statement 

I wish to implement a "Get Help" page that puts the most commonly asked questions in one spot. This is beucaause the current navigataion menu is cluttered nad looks different on certian pages. 

## Competitor Analysis

[Please click here to view my heuristic evaluation.](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/blob/main/assignment01/README.md) This is for the website I will be working on, plus the New York unified courts system website. This details certain design criteria that are strong, and shortcomings based on a review against certain criteria. The court system in the State of New York is one of the largest and oldest in the country. Handling nearly four million cases a year , it is imperative that the New York Government has robust and easy-to-navigate websites for users to find resources and help. Considering that New York's different courts handle different types of cases, it's important for users to be able to help themselves using the website. This project will examine UX design choices that work well, and choices that can be implemented to make the website easier to navigate, as well as a platform that is accessible for everyone.


[Please click here to view my pilot test.](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment02) This is the first interview I did with a participant, gathering their feedback and initial thoughts on the website. After conducting a thorough heurisitic evaluation of the website, a large amount of issues popped up with consistency and ease of use. [(See the heuristic evaluation here)](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment01) To evaluate these assumptions, it's important to understand how these flaws affect users in the real world. This is where usability testing (UT) comes into play. Since the website had significant issues with [visibility of system status](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visibility-system-status/), [consistency and standards](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/consistency-and-standards/), and [error prevention](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/slips/), among others, this project will evaluate how these issues impede a user from doing what they are trying to do.  

## User Research 

[Please click here to view my contextual inquiry.](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment03) This involved answering a series of detailed questions that assessed a user's background and their intents. 

[Please click here to view my persona and scenario assignment.](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment04) With this stage, I did research to identify the users and demographics that would be most likely to use this website. This feedback would help me keep in mind who I am designing this project for.

[Please click here to view this assignment](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment05) During this process, I constructed a low fidelity prototype of the design feaures I wanted to implement on this website. This was an early stage design that I sketched out, and I made some improvements along the way. 

## Wireframe and Graphic Design
[View the first high-res protype here.](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment06) This is the part where all the creative design process come to life. Building on the principles we have learned thus far, it is now time to build the first design iterations for our project. Design and aethetic choices are important, so this project will involve multiple iterations with different colors and fonts, and lots of testing. These first design prototypes will allow us to create a viable and functional protype later on (which will happen in the next project). The best way to create a great interface design is by doing a lot of design variations, and iterations so it's time to do that.

[View the first interactive prototype here](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment07). Now is the time to create the first interactive prototype, this an exciting stage where all the different screens and designs are connected into one logical flow, and we get to assess how the user-friendly the new UX protype is. Using the protyping tools in Figma, I can assign clickable elements, and link them together in a flow, to mimic how the interactions would take place (hence the prototype).

## Low-fidelity Prototype

[Please view my wireflow and low fidelity protoype here](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment05). A key part of introducing new features to a website, app, or platform, is by iteratively developing functions and interactions that are maximized for the user. Creating prototypes are a critical stage in doing so. Low fidelity prototypes allow for detailed testing of a website, app or platform before the expensive process where the high quality mockups are generated. When the higher quality designs are generated, it is difficult to reverse or take a step backward. This is a crucial stage before the design and aesthetic choices come into play.
