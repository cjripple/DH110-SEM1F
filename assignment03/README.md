## Research Goals and Requirements

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?

This project aims to help users navigate options and resources quickly and easily and navigate disputes regarding cases handled by New York Judges. It also seeks to make people's options and legal rights explicit and easily accessible for New York residents. 

#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?

Although individuals can send in a complaint by walking in or mailing a form, the user would need an internet connected device to use the website. This website helps users understand their rights (a basic need) when they experience midconduct from an NY judge. 

#### What are the traditional/current solutions to satisfy the needs?

The current solution is by filing a complaint by walking into the office or mailing a form instead of using the website. There aren't many other options, but a user can find this project by a quick Google search. 

#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

This can make resources easily available for people who are not near the New York Commission on Judicial Conduct office. It also allows users to file and submit a complaint faster and easier. Digital technology also allows someone to consult the office easier. 

## Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users?

The audience profile who uses this website is pretty diverse. The average age is estimated ~35 years old, with the majority of users being from minority backgrounds who are interested in their legal rights. Users are in the working class and low-income backgrounds. 

#### In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity?

The context here is very specific. This is for citizens in the State of New York who are interested in filing a complaint and/or investigating misconduct from a New York Judge. In some cases, a user may look up this website for research purposes in advance, or might be doing research to help a friend, but most of the time, the user will use the website to help themselves after an interaction with a judge. 

#### What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 

The user will most likely talk to a another New York deparment, such as one of the New York Courts about their legal options if they were unhappy with a judge's conduct. Secondly, they could likely be using Google or the internet to help them find this activity. Once they find the website, they will look around to see if (and how) the website can help them, and then they will fill out an online complaint intake form. 

## Qualitative research method

For this project, I wanted to focus on a way to gather insights in the way I saw best fit. This mostly involved active participatory interaction over Zoom, so I could observe a user and interact with them when and if I needed to. Performing the test over Zoom allowed me to seamlessly record the test to gather more insights easily.
