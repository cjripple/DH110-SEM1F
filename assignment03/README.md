## Research Goals and Requirements

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?

This project aims to help users navigate options and resources quickly and easily and navigate disputes regarding cases handled by New York Judges. It also seeks to make people's options and legal rights explicit and easily accessible for New York residents. 

#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?

Although individuals can send in a complaint by walking in or mailing a form, the user would need an internet connected device to use the website. This website helps users understand their rights (a basic need) when they experience midconduct from an NY judge. 

#### What are the traditional/current solutions to satisfy the needs?

The current solution is by filing a complaint by walking into the office or mailing a form instead of using the website. There aren't many other options, but a user can find this project by a quick Google search. 

#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

This can make resources easily available for people who are not near the New York Commission on Judicial Conduct office. It also allows users to file and submit a complaint faster and easier. Digital technology also allows someone to consult the office easier. 

## Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users?

The audience profile who uses this website is pretty diverse. The average age is estimated ~35 years old, with the majority of users being from minority backgrounds who are interested in their legal rights. Users are in the working class and low-income backgrounds. 

#### In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity?

The context here is very specific. This is for citizens in the State of New York who are interested in filing a complaint and/or investigating misconduct from a New York Judge. In some cases, a user may look up this website for research purposes in advance, or might be doing research to help a friend, but most of the time, the user will use the website to help themselves after an interaction with a judge. 

#### What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 

The user will most likely talk to a another New York deparment, such as one of the New York Courts about their legal options if they were unhappy with a judge's conduct. Secondly, they could likely be using Google or the internet to help them find this activity. Once they find the website, they will look around to see if (and how) the website can help them, and then they will fill out an online complaint intake form. 

## Qualitative research method

For this project, I wanted to focus on a way to gather insights in the way I saw best fit. This mostly involved active participatory interaction over Zoom, so I could observe a user and interact with them when and if I needed to. Performing the test over Zoom allowed me to seamlessly record the test to gather more insights easily.

## Key Insights and Quotes

###### "I'm assuming"
During a few of the search results, the user had low confidence on which search options were the correct ones. Often times, the user clicked on the wrong result and had to look around. 

###### "The judicial system reminds me of the social security system... it's confusing"
For many users who do not speak English as their first language, or young adults, this website is unclear and difficult to navigate. Having more training documentation and/or video tutorials may help with this barrier. 

###### These websites are more complex. They try to make it as easy as possible but there's just so much information on the website that sometimes I feel like you can get lost with all the information
Government websites are tricky to develop and present to the public because they serve the people, their business partners, other city departments, and their front-end and back-end operations. The user was asked to comment on the difference between government websites and business websites, and this was one of their concerns. 

## Reflection

Overall, I think it would have been best to focus on choosing a participant in the best target audience for my group. Asking my friends at UCLA is a fantastic option (and the best option for me), but they weren't the best one for this project. Becuase this website I chose is on judicial conduct, there are only a select few who actively use the website. As a result, I don't believe I got the most valuable feedback. When doing UX design in the future, I will make sure to screen out and choose participants that are the best match for the UX testing. 

However, I think that this insight creates opportunity to educate younger populations on the judicial system and how those operations work. If the Commission on Judicial Conduct help training sessions, YouTube videos, or visited schools or colleges, I'm sure that young adults would be more informed on how this worked. Since most young adults will not not how this website works, I think it also requires the website to update its search results to be more useful. So this shortcoming actually led to valuable feedback for the website, since connecting to younger adults is important. 

I took a few notes during the testing, however, for some reason, the Zoom recording did not include our faces. Even though our webcams were on and visible, they were not available in the recording. I will try to ensure this does not happen again. Either way, the user was very expressive verbally, so I am confident on the areas and times that the user struggled with. Another way to improve was ensuring a clearer starting point for the user. In an in-person setting, I would be able to get set up the device myself, but on Zoom, I have to direct the user to set up their screen. I should have made it clearer that the user was supposed to start on Google (or a search site) before using the actual website.  

Overall, this project was more fun and more involved for me compared to the previous Assignment 02. Since this test was less scripted, it felt more natural. Secondly, it was easier for me to observe a user's beahvior rather than outlining the exact steps they had to take (which is useful but not always realistic). I also felt like this user (compared to the previous user on assignment 02) was more willing to give detailed feedback on their interactions with the website. Giving the user more freedom allowed them to speak more freely about their experience using the website and the context in which they were using the site.
