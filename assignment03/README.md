## Research Goals and Requirements

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?

This project aims to help users navigate options and resources quickly and easily and navigate disputes regarding cases handled by New York Judges. It also seeks to make people's options and legal rights explicit and easily accessible for New York residents. 

#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?

Although individuals can send in a complaint by walking in or mailing a form, the user would need an internet connected device to use the website. This website helps users understand their rights (a basic need) when they experience midconduct from an NY judge. 

#### What are the traditional/current solutions to satisfy the needs?

The current solution is by filing a complaint by walking into the office or mailing a form instead of using the website. There aren't many other options, but a user can find this project by a quick Google search.
