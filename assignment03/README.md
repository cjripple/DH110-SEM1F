## Research Goals and Requirements

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?

This project aims to help users navigate options and resources quickly and easily and navigate disputes regarding cases handled by New York Judges. It also seeks to make people's options and legal rights explicit and easily accessible for New York residents. 

#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?

Although individuals can send in a complaint by walking in or mailing a form, the user would need an internet connected device to use the website. This website helps users understand their rights (a basic need) when they experience midconduct from an NY judge. 

#### What are the traditional/current solutions to satisfy the needs?

The current solution is by filing a complaint by walking into the office or mailing a form instead of using the website. There aren't many other options, but a user can find this project by a quick Google search. 

#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

This can make resources easily available for people who are not near the New York Commission on Judicial Conduct office. It also allows users to file and submit a complaint faster and easier. Digital technology also allows someone to consult the office easier. 

## Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users?

The audience profile who uses this website is pretty diverse. The average age is estimated ~35 years old, with the majority of users being from minority backgrounds who are interested in their legal rights. Users are in the working class and low-income backgrounds.
