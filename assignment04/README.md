## The Purpose of UX Storytelling

Because this website is meant to serve a wide population across the State of New York, it's important to consider diverse perspectives and stories in the target audience. This often includes minority populations, and people who do not speak English as their first language. UX Storytelling is important becuase we want a website and its contents to be accessible to everyone, and should empower and affirm people. We will be able to understand the NYC CJC website's through real user's stories, and be able to gain insights on their behavior, their context, adn their pain points. 

## Personas and Empathy Maps

### Introduction and Justifications for These Two Personas 

I specifically wanted to include two working-class citizens because the working-class employees are most likely to face discrimination or mistreatment at work and potentially, in the New York court system. Nost of the time, lower-middle class and low-income people are unaware of their rights, and are more vulnerable to unfair treatment for these reasons. In order to expand equity, it's important to serve these demographics with the personas and UX design planning, especially since they are likely to use the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct's services. 

### Persona 1: Imani Loyola - A technologist and customer support representative

## Proposed Features, Scenarios and Journey Maps

### Feature 1 - Self-Help Solutions Page (Imani)

#### Why?

Imani has a great support system around her, and she is not afraid to be vocal about her situation. From her employee resource groups, to her friends in the city, her friends on social meida, and family, she always knows that the people around her have her back. She is overwhelmed with all the help and support that she received after she faced discrimination at her last job, and is grateful for her support circles. She now works at a larger company and earns better pay too. However, the previous situation has not been fully dealt with, and she needs support as she cannot afford a lawyer and will need to represent herself. Additionally, after filing a complaint against the judge on the basis of abuse of discretion, she has go through an appeal process and do it all over again. To get pointed in the right direction, she calls the office whenever she has a question. However, since she works full-time, she can't always call as much as she would like. 

### How? 

Imani has been made aware of the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct's website after her friends tell her about it. She decides to take a look at the website, and calls the office to learn about the ways they can help her file a complaint against a judge. She does have the option of using the website, but the navigation and clunky, inconsistent, and not user friendly, so she reaches out over the phone for resources. However, she can't call as often as she would like becuase she works full-time and the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct is only available durirng limited hours, and she does not want to get help over email. Imani can easily adopt a new self-help & resources page that lists out the services, resources as well as related departments that can assist hee in getting the justice that she needs to get. 


### Feature 2 - Chatbot Search Solution (Hector)

During the pilot user testing and the contextual inquiry activities, a pressing issue that kept coming up was the issues using the search features on the website. It was confusing and did not make using the website any easier. Considering Hector's situation, a chatbot is the person solution to allow him to find answer to questions 24/7, and in multiple languages. 

#### Why? 

Hector is single and lives alone. Living in New York isn't the cheapest and he has some credit card debt that still needs to be paid off. He faces some language barriers but has trouble overcoming it due to the large amounts of Spanish spoken in the workplace, and his long work hours. At the same time, he doesn't know his options regarding his rights as an employee. After he gets hurt, he is able to get workers comp insurance, but he realizes that his accident at work could have been avoided, and that he can potentially sue for negligence. However, he felt like the  judge discriminated against him due to his lack of knowledge of English. After the hearing, he conduycted a Google search and came across the New York State - Commission on Judicial Conduct's website.  

#### How?

Hector came across the website after searching how to file a complaint and report a judge mishandling the case. At the same time, he consulted a lawyer who mentioned that they will need to work with this office. He finds the website pretty easily, but he is disappointed with how confusing the website is to navigate, and how it is packed with so much information. When he uses the Spanish options at the bottom of the website, he notices that certain important pages are still in English. He uses Google translate to try to dunerstand what is going on, but the information is unclear and he still has questions. He tries to call the office, but when he asks the persono if they speak English they say no, all people who spoke Spanish were out of office that day. Since Hector works long hours, he can't call anytime soon either during business hours. He can quickly and easily adopt the chatbot solution to answer his questions (in English and in Spanish) without having to confront a human or wait for them to respond. The answers are clear and precise, and it takes himt to the correct web page right away.  

## Hector's Journey Map

# Reflection

The feature requests were difficult to priortize becuase there are a lot of issues that affect the overall usability of the website. However, with all business operations, tasks need to be prioritized becuase not everything can be tackled on the same time. I thought the chatbot search soluation was a great way to tackle multiple usabililty issues at once.

I wanted to be mindful of the population that the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct serves. I work-part time with the City of Los Angeles in their Civil and Human Rights and Equity Departmnet, and we try to make our materials available in English, Spanish, but also Chinese, Mandarian, and other languages that comprise the LA population. I'm sure it is a similar case with the city of New york. I chose these two personas because these are demographics that we explored during my work, and we held information sessions for workers rights, and discrimination law for these personas that I included in my project.
