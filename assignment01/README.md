### About this Project

The court system in the State of New York is one of the largest and oldest in the country. Handling nearly four million cases a year [*](#*), it is imperative that the New York Government has robust and and easy-to-navigate websites for users to find resources and help. Considering that New York's different courts handle different types of cases, it's important for users to be able to help themselves using the website. This project will examine UX design choices that work well, and choices that can be implemented to make the website easier to navigate, as well as a platform that is accessible for everyone.

This website is managed by the State of New York, and it provides the public with resources and options for investigating judicial misconduct against certain judges in New York. One of the main purposes of the website is to make it easy to file a complaint, and to find relevant news, resources, and content. 

#### Goals

Make the website navigation more cohesive across pages to make the website easier and more consistent. Additionally, provide adjustments to make the website more accessible for various users. 

## Heuristic Evaluation

### #1 - Visibility of system status

Right away, the search bar is cluttered with multiple text boxes superimposed over each other, making it very difficult to read. This needs to be cleaned up. Please see the attachment below for reference, the issue is highlighted in a green rectangle. 

> * *Suggestion: Remove the Google Branding from the search bar or use another tool to make the search function easier to use.* 

![CJC Search Bar not displaying properly](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91553088/135388006-b02ad712-1c0e-41e7-b518-1c8b4f568877.jpg)

Secondly, there are no live search suggestions. This makes the website appear static and it's harder for users to find what they are looking for. 

> * *Suggestion: Although there may be a lot of search results, it would help the user find what they are looking for if there are live search suggeestions/reccomendations as soon as the user starts typing. Having only a couple of the most searched-for results pop up first can help with too many suggestions coming up at once.* 

When a user navigates around the website, the navigation menu updates with a "Home" icon to return to the home page. There is no hover effect for this action, like the rest of the menu items in the navigation menu. 

> * *Suggestion: Add a hover effect (such as a color change) to the home icon so users know that this button works, just like the rest of the buttons on the page.* 

Lastly, the links are hyperlinked and light up when hovered, but the "moused over" interaction spotlight could be a little more noticeable in the navigation menu. This is important so users can tell which page they are currently mousing over. This is important to system status becuause it is a design touchpoint that lets users know which page they are about to enter into.  

> * *Suggestion: Increase the amount of contrast between items that are moused over versus ones that are inactive. This will make it easier to navigate for individuals with vision impairments.* 

The website has an up-to-date banner with information on the Pandemic, which is good. 

#### Severity Rating for Heuristic #2 - 3

### #2 - Match between system and the real world

There are many references to several government positions and processes that require additional explanations. On the websitem, these have been hyperlinked to a page with more information.This can be very confusing for new visitors. If a user wanted to learn about what the CJC does, they will have to jump around multiple pages to find out what they do. 

![CJC Website - About Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91553088/135389832-1dde167b-4e69-4f78-ac50-7645bedef7a8.jpg)

> * *Suggestion: For some web pages, it would be helpful to provide a little more context on what certain terms might mean wiuthout them needing to leave the web page or use external resources. In the screenshot above, there is a lot of hyperlinked content that explains what each sentence is saying.* 

#### Severity Rating for Heuristic #2 - 1

### #3 - User control and freedom

The search results appear in a pop-up, rather than a results page, making it easy to lose search results if a user is not ready to click onto a new page. 

> * *Suggestion: Revamp the search function so users can save their search, or navigate the search function easier.* 

The logo on the top left of the navigation bar is not clickable, making it counterintuitive for users to return home. 

> * *Suggestion: Like the vast majority of websites, add a link to the CJC Banner on the navigation menu that takes users back to the home page.* 

The search option is only on the home page, making it difficult for users to find the search option once they start exploring the page. 

> * *Suggestion: Include the search option in the navigation menu of all web pages.* 

Other than that, the content and layout of the content on the website is simple and easy for a user to navigate. 

#### Severity Rating for Heuristic #3 - 2

### #4 - Consistency and standards

As mentioned above, going with the standard method to return home in the navigation menu is very important (see above). However, there are all sorts of issues with consistency of the Navigation Bar. 

![CJC Navigation Menu Comparison on the about page versus the home page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91553088/135391701-15acef60-dbe5-40b2-b857-347622e50834.jpg)

As highlighted in the screenshot, there are numerous differences in the menu items, leading to a very confusing and inconsistent experince for the viewer. The banner listing the Pandemic protocols disappears as soon as a user goes into one of the inner pages. The user will also lose access to the "Links" section as well as the "FAQ" section in the navigation menu unless they go back. The "File a Complaint" button needs to be on the navigation menu for all pages, since that is what the department investigates. It should be consistent and easy to find that option. It's also important to include the search options on the navigation menu on all pages, not just the home page. 

> * *Suggestion: The options in the navigation menu must be the same on all pages to provide a consistent experince. See the explanation above for which changes to implement. This earns a severity rating of 3 because it looks like two completely different websites when a user goes from the Home Page to another page on the site.* 

#### Severity Rating for Heuristic #4 - 3

### #5 - Error prevention

The website includes a some red dialogue boxes that include warnings on certain pages, which is good. However, the website does not include a footer. This can go in multiple Heuristic categories, but not having a Footer hurts error prevention, user control and freedom, and more. I put it in error prevention because many users go to the footer to look for a Privacy Policy, a contact option, an accessibility statement, and other important shortcuts for users. When there is no footer, the user is stuck with the content on the page. 

> * *Suggestion: A footer is extremely important. While this website does not need a lot done in terms of error prevention, a footer is really important to help users navigate a website, and help themselves. Many users use the Footer to find the Privacy Statement, Cookie Policy, Accessibility Statement, address and contact information, a disclaimer, a copyright statement, and other helpful shortcuts. This will get a Severity Rating of 3 for these reasons.* 

#### Severity Rating for Heuristic #5 - 3

### #6 - Recognition rather than recall

Because of the lack of consistency in the navigation menu, [(See Heuristic #4)](#4) it is very difficult for a user to recognize which menu item options are listed, including submenu items. 

> * *Suggestion: Address the Suggestions for Heuristic #4, and those changes will make the recognition aspect much easier for new and returning users.* 

On the good side, the content on the home page is simple, and easy to recognize right away. 

#### Severity Rating for Heuristic #6 - 3 (Same as #4)

### #7 - Flexibility and efficiency of use

The width of the website content does not stretch to the full length of the user's window, which can restrict how large the content appears on each user's screen. 

> * *Suggestion: Use Javascript (or other changes) to stretch the content width to 100%. That way, there is more room between website elements, and the elements are easier to see.* 

It is relatively easy for the user to find contact information and find information on filing a complaint, which is good. While the navigation menu is packed with many options, the web pages themselves are simple and easy to read. 

#### Severity Rating for Heuristic #7 - 1 

### #8 - Aesthetic and minimalist design

The design elements are not consistent, and most of the design elements appear outdated. While the banner at the top and buttons at the bottom have rounded edges, the ones on the web page have straight edges. On the home page, there are also multiple fonts being used inconsistently, and the icons on the home page are clunky and undesirable. 

> * *Suggestion: Improve how cohesive the design is overall by using rounded edges in more places, or abandoning them entirely. Use more consistent fonts by removing the Helvetica font on the first page.* 

![CJC Website, comparison of rounded-edged elements and straight edges.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91553088/135396179-c4471a28-8c40-4a27-96b4-e3a4176fc018.jpg)

On certain pages, the design is too simple and could be complimented with the use of images. Pages like the [Overview page](http://cjc.ny.gov/General.Information/overview.html) and the [Staff page](http://cjc.ny.gov/General.Information/Gen.Info.Pages/staff.html) need images to provide context to all the words on the screen. It will greatly help with the user's experience on the page. 

> * *Suggestion: Include a photo of the office, or a photo of New York to improve the design on the Overview page, and include staff headshots on the about page to add more elements to the page than just text.* 

#### Severity Rating for Heuristic #8 - 2

### #9 - Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

The website notifies users that when they use the search function, it appeaars in a pop-up window. It let's them know they need to scroll around or use the tab key, otherwise the window will close automatically. Also the contact option in the navigation menu makes that information easily available. There is also an accessibility toolbar to help users modify the contents on the screen to make them higher contrast, bold, etc. 

As mentioned previously, improving the search function would be helpful, and also including a Footer would help users tremendously. [(See Heuristic #5)](#5)

#### Severity Rating for Heuristic #9 - 1

### #10 - Help and documentation

As mentioned previously, including a Footer section would help users find access to tools, resources, options and help while using the site. [(See Heuristic #5)](#5). On the other hand, the contact information is easy for the user to find, which is good. On the "File a Complaint" page, the website walks the user through the process which is great. Other than that, the amount of help documentation is somewhat limited, but the website makes it relatively easy for user to find what they are looking for. 

#### Severity Rating for Heuristic #10 - 1

### Overall Takeaways

The website makes it eaasy for the public to use the website as intended, but it is outdated anad there are a lot of improvements that can be made. These improvements range from large to small, but they add up, and lead to an unpleasant experience for the user. While the website is functional, there are important changes to make across several heuristics.
