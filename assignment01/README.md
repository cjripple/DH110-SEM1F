### About this Project

The court system in the State of New York is one of the largest and oldest in the country. Handling nearly four million cases a year [*](#*), it is imperative that the New York Government has robust and and easy-to-navigate websites for users to find resources and help. Considering that New York's different courts handle different types of cases, it's important for users to be able to help themselves using the website. This project will examine UX design choices that work well, and choices that can be implemented to make the website easier to navigate, as well as a platform that is accessible for everyone. 

## Website 1 - New York State - Commission on Judicial Conduct

### Information About the Website
Link to website: http://cjc.ny.gov/

This website is managed by the State of New York, and it provides the public with resources and options for investigating judicial misconduct against certain judges in New York. One of the main purposes of the website is to make it easy to file a complaint, and to find relevant news, resources, and content. 

#### Goals

Make the website navigation more cohesive across pages to make the website easier and more consistent. Additionally, provide adjustments to make the website more accessible for various users. 

### Heuristic Evaluation

#### #1 - Visibility of system status

Right away, the search bar is cluttered with multiple text boxes superimposed over each other, making it very difficult to read. This needs to be cleaned up. Please see the attachment below for reference, the issue is highlighted in a green rectangle. 

> * *Suggestion: Remove the Google Branding from the search bar or use another tool to make the search function easier to use.*

Secondly, there are no live search suggestions. This makes the website appear static and it's harder for users to find what they are looking for. 

> * *Suggestion: Although there may be a lot of search results, it would help the user find what they are looking for if there are live search suggeestions/reccomendations as soon as the user starts typing. Having only a couple of the most searched-for results pop up first can help with too many suggestions coming up at once.* 

When a user navigates around the website, the navigation menu updates with a "Home" icon to return to the home page. There is no hover effect for this action, like the rest of the menu items in the navigation menu. 

> * *Suggestion: Add a hover effect (such as a color change) to the home icon so users know that this button works, just like the rest of the buttons on the page. * 

Lastly, the links are hyperlinked and light up when hovered, but the "moused over" interaction spotlight could be a little more noticeable in the navigation menu. This is important so users can tell which page they are currently mousing over. This is important to system status becuause it is a design touchpoint that lets users know which page they are about to enter into.  

> * *Suggestion: Increase the amount of contrast between items that are moused over versus ones that are inactive. This will make it easier to navigate for individuals with vision impairments.* 

#### #2 - Match between system and the real world

There are many references to several government positions and processes that require additional explanations. On the websitem, these have been hyperlinked to a page with more information.This can be very confusing for new visitors. If a user wanted to learn about what the CJC does, they will have to jump around multiple pages to find out what they do. 

![CJC Website - About Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91553088/135389832-1dde167b-4e69-4f78-ac50-7645bedef7a8.jpg)

> * *Suggestion: For some web pages, it would be helpful to provide a little more context on what certain terms might mean wiuthout them needing to leave the web page or use external resources. In the screenshot above, there is a lot of hyperlinked content that explains what each sentence is saying. * 

##### Severity Rating for Heuristic #2 - 1

#### #3 - User control and freedom

The search results appear in a pop-up, rather than a results page, making it easy to lose search results if a user is not ready to click onto a new page.
