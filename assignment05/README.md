## Overview of This Assignment

A key part of introducing new features to a website, app, or platform, is by iteratively developing functions and interactions that are maximized for the user. Creating prototypes are the first stage in doing so. Low fidelity prototypes allow for detailed testing of a website, app or platform *before* the expensive process where the high quality mockups are generated. When the higher quality designs are generated, it is difficult to reverse or take a step backward. This is a crucial stage before the design and aesthetic choices come into play. 

### Purpose 

This project seeks to experiment and verify if the suggested features on this website increase the usability of the platform. The specific issue I want to address is the lack of search options and the amount of time it takes users to find what they are looking for. This assignment will assess if the target demographic can adopt these features easily. 

### User Personas

Since this department is responsible for very specific tasks, the user personas are relatively narrow. I identified the target audience as adults 30 years old and up. Though not necessarily every time, they likely come from underrepresented backgrounds and are middle class. The population of New York is large and diverse. If you would like to see more information on the user personas, please [click here](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment04). 

### Features and Tasks

As outlined in the [previous assignment,](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment04) the two tasks that will be explored in this assignment are the (1) "Get Help" pages with resources and the (2) revamped search options and chat service. Both of these features will introduce faster solutions for visitors to help themselves. These features will also help with accessibilty on multiple points. You can see a breakdown of each feature and it's prototype below.

## Prototypes: Wireframes and Wireflows

Please watch the wireframe and wireflow construction process [here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D2GHq3gOPk1QnZ0669Loqsifu6DKAwf0L7XBPFdLB-4/edit?usp=sharing) At each step, my decisions are briefly explained with a justification for the features I implemented. For more information and context, please read the reflection at the end too.

## Protoype User Feedback

The user's feedback was good, and probably something I would have caught if I took a closer look myself. Please see below for more details. 

#### Tip #1 - Consistency of Positioning with the Back Buttons for the Chat and Search Solution

If you look at the wireflow for the automated chat and search solution, there is a "back" option for language selection and also a "back" option when downloading the chat. One is above the content, and the other is below. It's important that these stay consistent. 

#### Tip #2 - Using Icons Plus Text for the Control Bar of the Chat and Search Solution

Having three text buttons was fine, but the accessibility icon was unclear. This was something we talked about in class while learning about graphical user interfaces, that icons can be ambiguous. The best strategy would be to include buttons and icons to make the control bar at the bottom look nice. It makes it look like a nice operating system as well. 

#### Tip #3 - Adding a Search Bar on the Get Help Page

Part of what makes a user feel "in control" is having a search bar in case they feel like they are going to get stuck. It would be a good idea to include a search bar so the user can "fall back" to searching for what they want. This search bar would open the automated virtual chat assistant. 

### User Feedback Takeaways 

My user's feedback during the brief test of my low-fidelity protoype was super helpful. He mentioned that some of the options appeared similar to the navigation menu. Maybe it was a mistake to use the dropdown menus again, since that floods the users with options. However, after taking a look, he thought the grouping of the options was helpful. The chat bot ideas was also accepted by the user, he thought that it would make things straightforward, especially if someone was unable to call or email and ask a human for help. The language options with the chat are also great, although setting up translations can take some time. If it were to offer multiple languages, the virtual chat/search assistant could potentially be even more resourceful for someone compared to a human that might not speak a language that a citizen is comfortable speaking.

## Reflection


For the first feature suguestion, the "Get Help" page, this wireflow took a while to make. I constructed it by sketching it, then cut and paste the image into fragments. I then had to take a big deep dive into the website and understand the content across the whole site so I could organize the most important web pages into groups so they would be easy to find. When creating the wireflow, I tried to fit all the content on one page, so I gathered a lot of screenshots and web links and used arrows to connect the interactions. This was very time consuming. This page connects people to where they needed to go, so there weren't too many steps involved in the wireflow, but there were a lot of options to click on.  

For the second feature suggestion, the automated virtual chat solution, I was interested in replicating the chat option that the California DMV provides. I think that service is helpful, and the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct could really use a feature like this. Since a chat bot requires a "user inquiry" or "user intent" I could not plot out every possible type of command, but I did my best to show what the basic functionality of it looks like. When a user clicks in the corner, or opens a search dialog, the virtual search assistant will come up.

This exercise was a lot of fun becuase this is the part where all the research and background starts to develop into creativity. We can now make informed layout decisions since we know the paint points and goals that our user is trying to complete. I think there are a lot of improvements that I need to make, and I need to assess again with another user. One more idea I had that the user did not mention, was a microphone button to allow a user to speak a question or command to the virtual search assistant. This feature would be helpful for people who have issues typing. However, the virtual chat solution might take a lot of maintenance to set up properly and could require a lot of development, so this is something to consider. z
