## About This Assignment

A key part of introducing new features to a website, app, or platform, is by iteratively developing functions and interactions that are maximized for the user. Creating prototypes are the first stage in doing so. Low fidelity prototypes allow for detailed testing of a website, app or platform before the expensive process where the high quality mockups are generated. When the higher quality designs are generated, it is difficult to reverse or take a step backward.
