## New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct Project - Connor Ripple

## Introduction to the project

With this project, I wwant to redesign some features on the website to make it more cohesive, and easier for users to find what they need. Most users are looking for information on what they can do about judicial misconduct, and are looking for related resources. 

## Clear Design Statement 

I wish to implement a "Get Help" page that puts the most commonly asked questions in one spot. This is beucaause the current navigataion menu is cluttered nad looks different on certian pages. 

## Competitor Analysis

[Please click here to view my heuristic evaluation.](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/blob/main/assignment01/README.md) This is for the website I will be working on, plus the New York unified courts system website. This details certain design criteria that are strong, and shortcomings based on a review against certain criteria. The court system in the State of New York is one of the largest and oldest in the country. Handling nearly four million cases a year , it is imperative that the New York Government has robust and easy-to-navigate websites for users to find resources and help. Considering that New York's different courts handle different types of cases, it's important for users to be able to help themselves using the website. This project will examine UX design choices that work well, and choices that can be implemented to make the website easier to navigate, as well as a platform that is accessible for everyone.


[Please click here to view my pilot test.](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment02) This is the first interview I did with a participant, gathering their feedback and initial thoughts on the website. After conducting a thorough heurisitic evaluation of the website, a large amount of issues popped up with consistency and ease of use. [(See the heuristic evaluation here)](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment01) To evaluate these assumptions, it's important to understand how these flaws affect users in the real world. This is where usability testing (UT) comes into play. Since the website had significant issues with [visibility of system status](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visibility-system-status/), [consistency and standards](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/consistency-and-standards/), and [error prevention](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/slips/), among others, this project will evaluate how these issues impede a user from doing what they are trying to do.  

## User Research 

[Please click here to view my contextual inquiry.](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment03) This involved answering a series of detailed questions that assessed a user's background and their intents. 

[Please click here to view my persona and scenario assignment.](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment04) With this stage, I did research to identify the users and demographics that would be most likely to use this website. This feedback would help me keep in mind who I am designing this project for.

[Please click here to view this assignment](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment05) During this process, I constructed a low fidelity prototype of the design feaures I wanted to implement on this website. This was an early stage design that I sketched out, and I made some improvements along the way. 

## Wireframe and Graphic Design
[View the first high-res protype here.](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment06) This is the part where all the creative design process come to life. Building on the principles we have learned thus far, it is now time to build the first design iterations for our project. Design and aethetic choices are important, so this project will involve multiple iterations with different colors and fonts, and lots of testing. These first design prototypes will allow us to create a viable and functional protype later on (which will happen in the next project). The best way to create a great interface design is by doing a lot of design variations, and iterations so it's time to do that.

Now is the time to create the first interactive prototype, this an exciting stage where all the different screens and designs are connected into one logical flow, and we get to assess how the user-friendly the new UX protype is. Using the protyping tools in Figma, I can assign clickable elements, and link them together in a flow, to mimic how the interactions would take place (hence the prototype).

## Low-fidelity Prototype

[Please view my wireflow and low fidelity protoype here](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/tree/main/assignment05). A key part of introducing new features to a website, app, or platform, is by iteratively developing functions and interactions that are maximized for the user. Creating prototypes are a critical stage in doing so. Low fidelity prototypes allow for detailed testing of a website, app or platform before the expensive process where the high quality mockups are generated. When the higher quality designs are generated, it is difficult to reverse or take a step backward. This is a crucial stage before the design and aesthetic choices come into play.

## Conclusion and Reflection 

This project taught me a lot, and it was so much fun to take a dive into UX Research. Here are some of my findings:

### Takeaways 

There is a huge need for effective communicators, storytellers, and UX Researchers to improve the usability of government websites and services. There is still a lot more websites and projects that are needed to make other government websites accessible, navigable, and easy to use.

While there is a broad audience that New York State - Commission on Judicial Conduct serves, it is essential and relatively easy to pinpoint a target demographic.  Itâ€™s important to keep this user in mind while constructing the website, and designing features in a way that is accessible, easy for older adults to follow, and provides feedback on if the user is making progress while navigating the website or not. Lots of users fail or get stuck while using government websites, including this one. 

Thoroughness really matters.  The time I put into research, design and development really paid off and allowed me to gain more insights about how my products was going to perform, and ways I could improve my product. I learned that I needed to schedule and organize any projects while working with various  users/participants and supervisors and peers, and make it a process of improvement over time. 

### Future Suggestions For Improvement

I did not have enough time or direct access with the New York State - Commission on Judicial Conduct, so I felt like I could have done a better job organizing the information and putting it in one place as best as I could. Improvements can be made in that aspect.

Ideally, it would be great to test the live prototype using a tool like Hotjar, which tracks user progress and heat maps clicks and where users get stuck.  If I had more time, I would do this. Microsoft clarity is a great free tool, and is something I would use next.  

I would like to create a multi-device prototype next time, including a desktop version of my website with extended filters and functionality. During this course, I only focused on mobile prototypes. I chose the the mobile prototype because it was how users would most likely try to find relevant resources and information, when they are on the go and need to find information quickly. Also trying a completely different layout just to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each. 

One thing I learned while doing this project (if I were to do it again) is to pay attention to previous findings during each stage of the process. During one of my last assignments, I realized I forgot to implement something I found earlier in the year, so I want to reiterate how important it is to stay focused on your findings and takeaways as you move into different project phases.
