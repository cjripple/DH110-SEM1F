## Overview of This Assignment

Now is the time to create the first interactive prototype, this an exciting stage where all the different screens and designs are connected into one logical flow, and we get to assess how the user-friendly the new UX protype is. Using the protyping tools in Figma, I can assign clickable elements, and link them together in a flow, to mimic how the interactions would take place (hence the prototype). 

Using the feedback from all the color and design variations I tested [last week on Assignment 06](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/blob/main/assignment06/README.md) , I have a strong idea of how the visuals elements on my prototype will look like. It's now time to design a seamless flow that is easy for the user to navifgate. 

## Improvements Based on Peer Review

Last Tuesday, November 16, we went though a light peer review with classmates and provided feedback on each other's designs. This session was super helpful becuase I got valuable feedback on ways to improve my website. One suggestion that I loved was adding a footer content to my webpage. When I first created the prototype, I didn't really think about how I would design the bottom of the webpages, so the input from my peers was super helpful. I originally did not include a footer, becuase the original website did not have one. In my heuristic evaluation, I mentioned that a header was needed, to elevate the deesign, help with navigation, and for accessibility. Most government websites have a footer, so I made sure to include one, which you can see below. 

As part of the iterative design process, I went back to my first heuristic evaluation to remember what the issues were wit the original website, and what I could do now to make the most of those problems and shortcomings. This was a good exercise to reflect on the design preferences I had at the beggining of class until now. A couple takeaways I had were (1) a footer needs to be implemented.
