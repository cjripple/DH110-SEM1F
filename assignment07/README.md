## Overview of This Assignment

Now is the time to create the first interactive prototype, this an exciting stage where all the different screens and designs are connected into one logical flow, and we get to assess how the user-friendly the new UX protype is. Using the protyping tools in Figma, I can assign clickable elements, and link them together in a flow, to mimic how the interactions would take place (hence the prototype). 

Using the feedback from all the color and design variations I tested [last week on Assignment 06](https://github.com/cjripple/DH110-SEM1F/blob/main/assignment06/README.md) , I have a strong idea of how the visuals elements on my prototype will look like. It's now time to design a seamless flow that is easy for the user to navifgate. 

## Improvements Based on Peer Review

Last Tuesday, November 16, we went though a light peer review with classmates and provided feedback on each other's designs. This session was super helpful becuase I got valuable feedback on ways to improve my website. One suggestion that I loved was adding a footer content to my webpage. When I first created the prototype, I didn't really think about how I would design the bottom of the webpages, so the input from my peers was super helpful. I originally did not include a footer, becuase the original website did not have one. In my heuristic evaluation, I mentioned that a header was needed, to elevate the deesign, help with navigation, and for accessibility. Most government websites have a footer, so I made sure to include one, which you can see below. 

As part of the iterative design process, I went back to my first heuristic evaluation to remember what the issues were wit the original website, and what I could do now to make the most of those problems and shortcomings. This was a good exercise to reflect on the design preferences I had at the beggining of class until now. A couple takeaways I had were (1) a footer needs to be implemented, the (2) design of the footer needs to be elevated (3) improve the search navigation to make it easier for the use and (4) use more images in my design. There were a lot of other comments I made in the first heuristic evaluation, but they can't really be implemented in the context of this class, or need to be added later on. For example, including cover effects on elements is not easy to do using Figma. 

### Tasks that This New Protoype Supports

This prototype will empower the user to do a few new things. First of all, this protype tests an all-new footer that the original website does not have. This will make it look better design-wise and help users navigate the website easier. Additionally, this protype explores the expanded and improved search function that has clearer nad more accurate results. It is also easier for the user to review their search, or search for a new term. Overall, there are search improvements across the board. Lastly, this prototype allows users to test what the "Get Help" page looks like when users click on the options, such as complaints.

The top image is the original, and the one below it demonstrates the first protoype of my footer. I am going to run it by my peers and see what they think about the footer, and see if I should add or remoove any links. 

## Protoype Flow
I know how frustrating it is to be stuck on a webpage and have buttons that don't work, or to be confused about where to go next. I made sure to make the navigation elements like the header and footer clickable so they take the user back to the start page. I also added "cancel" and "X" buttons so users can easily go back a step. All actions had a cancel or reverse option so users could easily go back, to find what they are looking for. The screenshot below details the flow of the protoype I created. Some clickable buttons take users to a URL on the website. That is what the chain link represents.

To test the protoype, press the "play" icon in the top right corner.
